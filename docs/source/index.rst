Welcome to the demo documentation!
===================================

Introduction
--------------------
Read the Docs is powered by Sphinx. You can import your project from
a github repository. 

- You will need to wirte your documents in rst (reStructuredText)
- Put it in the docs/ folder under you main folder, I might get it ready for you  
- The root file is index.rst (required)
- This documentation is *live* and hosted by the Read the Docs  server, when you make changes in your rst file, the doc will automatically change

How to start
---------------------
1. Download VS code (prefered markdown editor) if you don't have yet.
2. Prepare your documentation in RST format (multiple pages are allowed)
3. Add to the github repository
